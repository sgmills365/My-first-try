# My-first-try
my first experimental attempt on this program. 
So far I belief it is going well. I'm becoming more and more familiar with the program. 


==================
##What does this do?
==================
###~~{{does this do anything?}}~~ no, it _does_ not.

###**Somethings to know about Jake the Dog**

He is Part Demon and therefore very stretchy, though he claims he rolled in mud one day and that's how he got his stretchy powers.
